	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src=""/>
		<p>Hello! Let me introduce myself. Why "Jay"? I was given my mother's name, and have used my middle name since.</p>

		<p>I have had quite a few life experiences, from school in public schools to college and university to beginning a career to marriage and parenthood to re-entering the work force. In addition I have lived in  a few different communities, through family childhood moves to six cities to choosing colleges to relocating for career and family locations.  I have also seen several other parts of the world through personal travel,  including Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, Japan, and New Zealand.</p>

		<p>My first career choice was librarianship, with a focus on reference services and programs for adults. This was both rewarding and challenging: rewarding to bring services to a community and, in retrospect, challenging since technologies we take for granted did not exist then. Following time spent raising children and volunteering for a few organizations, I re-entered the world of libraries as a children's librarian.  It soon became obvious I needed the same schedule as my family, so I then began a fifteen-year career in  public schools with the title “Library Media Specialist.”  This, too, was rewarding since I was able to help children with their learning and their reading needs.  It was challenging in its own way, requiring constant professional development to improve and learn new skills.</p>

		<p>Now I have decided to pursue a new career, one which I believe I can enrich by bringing along my professional and personal experiences. </p>

		<p>Oh, yes, what do I enjoy outside of work? Walking my dog, riding my horse (dressage, please!), sewing crafts, reading, and of course spending time with family and friends.
